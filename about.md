# About the Joint Centre for Disaster Research

The Joint Centre for Disaster Research (JCDR) is a collaborative research centre established between Massey University and GNS Science. We are dedicated to advancing knowledge in disaster risk reduction, emergency management, and building resilient communities.

## Our Mission

To conduct world-class, interdisciplinary research that enhances New Zealand's and the Pacific region's resilience to natural hazards and disasters through innovative science, education, and community engagement.

## Research Areas

### Natural Hazards Science
- Earthquake engineering and seismology
- Volcanic hazards and risk assessment
- Tsunami modeling and coastal hazards
- Landslide risk and slope stability
- Flooding and hydrological hazards

### Social Vulnerability and Resilience
- Community-based disaster risk reduction
- Social vulnerability assessment
- Indigenous knowledge systems
- Climate change adaptation
- Post-disaster recovery processes

### Risk Assessment and Management
- Multi-hazard risk modeling
- Infrastructure vulnerability assessment
- Emergency management planning
- Risk communication strategies
- Decision support systems

### Technology and Innovation

- Machine learning for hazard assessment
- Early warning systems
- Damage assessment technologies
- Resilience monitoring tools

## Our Partners

### Massey University
The School of People, Environment and Planning at Massey University provides the social science foundation for our disaster research, focusing on human dimensions of disasters, community resilience, and risk communication.

### GNS Science
GNS Science contributes expertise in natural hazards science, geological processes, and geophysical monitoring, providing the physical science foundation for understanding natural hazard processes.

### International Collaborations
We maintain active research partnerships with leading institutions worldwide, including:
- University of Canterbury (New Zealand)
- Tokyo University (Japan)
- Stanford University (USA)
- University College London (UK)
- Pacific Island universities and research institutions
