# Research at JCDR

Our research spans multiple disciplines and addresses critical challenges in disaster risk reduction and resilience building. We take an interdisciplinary approach, combining natural hazards science with social science research to develop comprehensive solutions for disaster risk management.

## Featured Research Projects

### Multi-Hazard Risk Assessment for New Zealand
A comprehensive national-scale project developing integrated risk models that consider earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, flooding, and climate-related hazards. This work supports national disaster risk reduction planning and infrastructure resilience strategies.

**Lead Researchers:** Prof. David Johnston, Dr. Nick Horspool  
**Duration:** 2022-2025  
**Funding:** MBIE Endeavour Fund

### Community Resilience in Small Island Developing States
This project works with Pacific Island communities to understand traditional knowledge systems and develop culturally appropriate disaster risk reduction strategies. Research includes vulnerability assessments, adaptation planning, and capacity building initiatives.

**Lead Researchers:** Dr. Julia Becker, Prof. Emma Hudson-Doyle  
**Duration:** 2023-2026  
**Funding:** DFAT Pacific Research Program

### AI for Rapid Disaster Response
Developing machine learning algorithms for automated damage assessment using satellite imagery, social media data, and sensor networks. This technology aims to provide real-time situational awareness during disaster events.

**Lead Researchers:** Dr. Uma Shankar Dhakal, Prof. Mark Stirling  
**Duration:** 2024-2027  
**Funding:** Marsden Fund
