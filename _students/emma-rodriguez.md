## Research Focus

My research examines the intersection of climate change and coastal hazards, with particular emphasis on developing adaptation strategies for Pacific Island communities. I investigate how sea level rise, changing storm patterns, and tsunami risks will affect vulnerable coastal populations.

## Current Projects

### Climate Change Impacts on Tsunami Risk
Analyzing how future sea level rise will modify tsunami inundation patterns and developing updated risk assessment methodologies that incorporate climate projections.

### Pacific Island Adaptation Strategies
Working with Pacific Island communities to develop culturally appropriate adaptation strategies for climate-related coastal hazards, incorporating traditional knowledge with scientific modeling.

### Coastal Infrastructure Vulnerability Assessment
Evaluating the vulnerability of critical coastal infrastructure to combined climate and geological hazards, developing decision-support tools for adaptation planning.

## Research Approach

My work integrates physical modeling with social science approaches, using hydrodynamic modeling to assess hazard changes while employing participatory methods to understand community needs and priorities. I work closely with Pacific Island partners to ensure research relevance and cultural appropriateness.

## Global Significance

This research addresses critical gaps in climate adaptation planning for small island developing states, providing tools and frameworks that can be applied across the Pacific region to support climate resilience building efforts.
