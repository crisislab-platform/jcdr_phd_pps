## Research Focus

My research develops innovative approaches for seismic risk assessment using machine learning and remote sensing technologies. I focus on creating rapid, automated systems for post-earthquake damage assessment and improving vulnerability models for New Zealand's building stock.

## Current Projects

### AI-Powered Post-Earthquake Damage Assessment
Developing deep learning algorithms that can automatically identify and classify building damage from satellite and drone imagery following earthquake events. This system aims to provide rapid damage assessment to support emergency response efforts.

### Fragility Function Development for NZ Buildings
Creating comprehensive fragility curves for different building typologies across New Zealand, incorporating local construction practices and seismic characteristics. This work supports national seismic risk modeling efforts.

### School Seismic Safety Assessment
Conducting detailed vulnerability assessments of school buildings in the Wellington region, combining structural analysis with machine learning approaches to prioritize retrofit interventions.

## Technical Approach

My research combines traditional structural engineering principles with cutting-edge data science techniques. I use computer vision for automated damage detection, statistical modeling for fragility analysis, and finite element methods for detailed structural simulations.

## Impact and Applications

This research directly supports New Zealand's disaster risk reduction efforts by providing tools for rapid damage assessment and improved building vulnerability modeling. The methodologies developed are being integrated into national seismic risk assessment frameworks.
