## Research Focus

My research investigates how social vulnerability factors influence community resilience to natural disasters in New Zealand. I focus particularly on rural and indigenous communities, examining how social capital, economic resources, and institutional support networks affect disaster preparedness and recovery outcomes.

## Current Projects

### Social Vulnerability Mapping for Canterbury Region
Developing comprehensive social vulnerability indices for rural Canterbury communities, incorporating demographic, socioeconomic, and infrastructure variables to identify areas of highest risk.

### MƒÅori Community Resilience Study
Collaborating with local iwi to understand traditional knowledge systems and their role in disaster risk reduction, with a focus on culturally appropriate resilience strategies.

### Post-Disaster Social Cohesion Analysis
Analyzing how community social networks change following major disaster events, using data from the 2010-2011 Canterbury earthquakes and Cyclone Gabrielle.

## Research Methodology

My work employs mixed-methods approaches, combining quantitative spatial analysis with qualitative ethnographic methods. I use participatory research frameworks that center community voices and indigenous knowledge systems in disaster risk reduction planning.
