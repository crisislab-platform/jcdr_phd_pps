Our latest research on community resilience in rural New Zealand has been published in the International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction. This study examines how social capital and community networks influence disaster preparedness and recovery outcomes.

The research, conducted across 12 rural communities in Canterbury, reveals significant variations in resilience levels based on factors such as community leadership, social cohesion, and access to resources. Key findings include:

- Communities with strong social networks showed 40% faster recovery times following the 2010-2011 Canterbury earthquakes
- Local leadership quality was the strongest predictor of long-term community resilience
- Economic diversity played a crucial role in maintaining community stability during extended recovery periods

This work contributes to our understanding of how to build more resilient rural communities and provides practical guidance for emergency management planning.
