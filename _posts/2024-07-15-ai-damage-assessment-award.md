The machine learning system for automated post-earthquake damage assessment, developed as part of my PhD research, has been awarded the 2024 Innovation in Disaster Technology Prize by the New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering.

The system combines satellite imagery, drone surveillance, and social media data to provide rapid damage assessments within hours of a major earthquake event. During testing with 2016 Kaik≈çura earthquake data, the system achieved 92% accuracy in damage classification across different building types.

## Key Features

- **Rapid Processing**: Damage maps generated within 2-4 hours of image acquisition
- **Multi-Source Integration**: Combines satellite, aerial, and ground-level imagery
- **Scalable Architecture**: Can process entire city-scale areas simultaneously
- **Real-Time Updates**: Incorporates new data streams as they become available

## Implementation Plans

Civil Defence Emergency Management is currently evaluating the system for integration into national emergency response protocols. Pilot testing is planned for the Wellington region, with potential national rollout in 2025.

The system represents a significant advancement in our ability to rapidly assess disaster impacts and coordinate emergency response efforts effectively.

## Collaboration Opportunities

We're seeking partnerships with international research institutions and emergency management agencies interested in implementing similar systems. The open-source framework will be made available to the research community later this year.
